Desktop Wallet application for tnb
Plugins that allows connection to merhcant services and tnb blockchain

#### What problem does it solve?
Decentralized interaction with the chain

#### Who is the target market?
Site operators, Project creators, e-commerce services

#### What do you think is the opportunity of this project?
To allow decentralized logins and communication to the chain from the Browser/Desktop/in-game and App.

#### How does it integrate with thenewboston digital currency work?
Partnering with the thenewboston-js team for API features. Creating a handshake between sites and the browser that allows them to connect to the chain.

#### Are there any competitors?
As of now? Not that I know of.

#### Will, you need specific information or advice?
Yes, I will need to work with the TNB JS API team to build out the documentation and API's to make the browser extension have more features.

#### What are your goals and objectives?
Wide-scale adoption of the currency and to keep it decentralized.

#### How will you evaluate project success?
By seeing wide adoption from online services and users.

#### What risks should you plan to manage?
Honestly, there isn’t much risk. It’s a decentralized application. It all depends on how the community takes the app and uses it. But from what I have seen from most chains that have browser plugins. Having something like this makes adoption a lot easier.

#### Extra information:

**Feature set:**
- Store an unlimited number of account keys, encrypted with AES
- Api to allow public/private key matches to allow for a decentralized login system.
- Api to allow fast coin sending via the browser from just the click of buttons.
- Wallet creation
- List of public servers to sign transactions with.
- And much more

**Example:**
**Decentralized login:**
Browser handshake: calls to chrome or firefox extension 
If private key matches public key send true if valid send confirmation
